We started with roadmaps, guides, videos and other visual content but we plan on introducing best practices, best-practices for certain tasks, quizzes to test your knowledge and prepare yourself for the interviews, project ideas to work on while following the roadmaps, public profiles to share your progress and interact with the other learners and so on.</p>
