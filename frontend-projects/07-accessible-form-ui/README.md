# Accessible Form UI

## Goal
In this project, you are required to create a form UI using only HTML and CSS. The form will include fields for a full name, email, password, and confirm password, along with a button to toggle the visibility of the password text. Additionally, the form will feature a completeness progress bar and a checklist of requirements that must be met for the form to reach 100% completeness.

P.S. However i used javascript to make the design interactive as a really important part of the goal would have been missing
