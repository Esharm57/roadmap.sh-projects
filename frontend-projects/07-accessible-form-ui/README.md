# Accessible Form UI

## Goal

In this project, you are required to create a form UI using only HTML and CSS. The form will include fields for a full name, email, password, and confirm password, along with a button to toggle the visibility of the password text. Additionally, the form will feature a completeness progress bar and a checklist of requirements that must be met for the form to reach 100% completeness.

### Key points to keep in mind while creating an accessible form UI:

1. Labeling: Ensure that each form field has a corresponding <label> element that is clearly associated with the field using the for attribute.
2. Focus State: Style the focus state of each input field so that users navigating with a keyboard can easily see which field is currently active.
3. Interactive Elements: Make sure that the button to show/hide the password is accessible via keyboard and screen readers, providing clear feedback on the current state (e.g., “Password is hidden” or “Password is visible”).

P.S. However i used javascript to make the design interactive as a really important part of the goal would have been missing
