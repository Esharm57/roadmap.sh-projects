# Personal Portfolio

## Goal

In this project, you will style the HTML website structure you created previously in a different project. The focus will be on learning how to use CSS to create responsive layouts, apply color and typography, and enhance the overall design of your website.

### Your submission should include:

1. A fully styled, responsive website with the same structure as the previous project.
2. Consistent use of a chosen color scheme and typography.
3. Proper use of CSS techniques like Flexbox, media queries, and the box model.
4. A responsive navigation bar and well-styled contact form.
